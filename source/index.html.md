# Introduction

The CharityBase REST API provides public information regarding the activities, locations and finances of all currently registered charities in England and Wales.  The API powers the [CharityBase Web App](https://charitybase.uk) - see the [About](https://charitybase.uk/about) page for more information.

To get started, sign up for an API key from the [API Portal](https://charitybase.uk/api-portal).
