### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 2.3.1 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Useful commands

```shell
# Install dependencies
bundle install
```

```shell
# Run locally for development
bundle exec middleman server
```

```shell
# Build for production
bundle exec middleman build --clean
```
